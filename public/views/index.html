        <span>Hey There!</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm Kelly, a former <span>chemical engineer</span> transitioning into the field of computer science. 
        Currently, I'm navigating the complexities of coding while managing a <span>caf√©</span>, fueled by my genuine love for coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
        When not immersed in the digital realm, I enjoy <span>bouldering</span>  at the local gym, 
        seeking the same thrill offline as I do online.
    </p>
    <p>
        Join me in exploring the convergence of <span>tech, coffee, and climbing</span>. 
        Here's to a future filled with possibilities and coding adventures!
